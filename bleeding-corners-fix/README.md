# Bleeding Corners Fix
Zen Browser uses border radius to round the corners of the web page.

On some websites, the HTML background color can sometimes bleed-through the edges of the border radius, usually creating a white outline or artifact. This mod prevents this by applying a simple clip-path to the container, without compromising any content on the containers edge.

> Mods may break in later versions. I use these mods myself, and keep them up-to-date with the latest versions of Zen. If something doesn't work as intended, feel free to [reach out](mailto:roman@rsiebert.dev). Made with 💖 by Roman.
