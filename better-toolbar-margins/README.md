# Better Toolbar Margins
Zen Browser uses very tight margins. This mod improves both the toolbar and sidebar margins, and fixes various other margins.
Unlike other mods, this has been extensively tested and aims to work with any layout.

> These mods may break or become depreciated as Zen Browser updates. However, I try to keep them up-to-date with the latest versions of Zen. If something isn't working or doesn't feel right, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/rsiebertdev/zen-themes/issues/new). Made with 💖 by Roman.
